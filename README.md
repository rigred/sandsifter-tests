# sandsifter-tests
A repository of result for runs of sandsifter on various x86 CPU's

## Alert
Due to a recently found fault in the way the injector was compiled all but two test results stopped prematurely at the below instructions:
 * 660f1fff
 * 660f8fff000000

> This primarily affected Intel CPU's - this means that all Intel CPU submissions would have to be retested. The old results can be found in the invalid_tests branch.

## Pull Requests with your logs welcome!

Make sure your submissions are compressed with
```
tar c data/log | xz -9 > brand_model-modelnumber.tar.xz
```

### Test command:

Be sure your terminal has xterm colors set and is as large as you can make it. 80x40 should suffice.
```
export TERM='xterm-256color'
```

Then run the test with the following command
```
./sifter.py --unk --dis --len --sync --tick -- -P1 -t
```

### Compression
> Log data is compressed With xz -9 and will uncompress to a good bit larger size
Special attention is needed with the Ryzen CPU test data. The dump files for those are near 1.4Gb total when uncompressed. 
Running this through the analysis tool will consume a substantial amount of RAM.

## CPU's tested:

### AMD

* Zen
    * [R7 1700x](https://github.com/rigred/sandsifter-tests/blob/master/amd/Zen/ryzen-1700x.tar.xz)
    * [R7 1700](https://github.com/rigred/sandsifter-tests/blob/master/amd/Zen/amd_ryzen-1700.tar.xz)

    > *Warning:* The Zen CPU logs are LARGE. Processing these with the summarizer requires a substantial amount of RAM and CPU time.

### Intel

* Prescott
    * [Intel Pentium 4 630](https://github.com/rigred/sandsifter-tests/blob/master/intel/intel_pentium_4-630.tar.xz)
